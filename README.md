elitalon's dotfiles
===================


Installation
------------

You can clone the repository wherever you want. The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elitalon/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```


OS X defaults
----------------------

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```
